# X Post: Scraping Test Results

## Option 1: Results-Focused (Recommended)
```
Just ran our first scraping test on AcquiTalent AI 🧪

Results in 2.3 seconds:
• 152 signals from 5 sources (LinkedIn, podcasts, content, Twitter, conferences)
• 47 unique VP-level candidates identified
• 23 high-score candidates (70+ openness) ready for outreach
• Avg score: 78.5

@sama's insight in action: AI processes 66 signals/second—impossible for humans.

Traditional recruiter: 50-100 candidates/week
AcquiTalent AI: 47 candidates in 2.3 seconds

The future of executive search is here. 🚀

## Option 3: Visual Story (Thread)
```
🧵 Thread: Just tested AcquiTalent AI's scraping engine

1/ @sama said AI token activity surpasses human activity. We built AcquiTalent AI to prove it.

Just ran our first test:

2/ In 2.3 seconds, we:
• Scraped 5 data sources
• Collected 152 signals
• Identified 47 VP-level candidates
• AI scored them all

3/ Results:
• 23 candidates with 70+ openness scores
• Ready for personalized outreach
• Avg score: 78.5

4/ The math:
Traditional recruiter: 50-100 candidates/week
AcquiTalent AI: 47 candidates in 2.3 seconds

That's 66 signals processed per second.

5/ This is what @sama meant: AI doesn't just automate—it operates at a different scale of intelligence.

We're not just finding candidates faster. We're finding candidates humans can't see.
